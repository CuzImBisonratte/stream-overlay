!!! WARNING: The Github Pages instances only work with the "overlay" folder in the root of the repository. All other files would react to things on my channel... !!!


## Hosting
If you don't want to use your pc as a server, you can either use a version of our overlay (which is hosted on github, but the mobile control doesn't work) or you can host it yourself on a mini-pc like a raspberry pi.


# Interactives - Control Buttons
The /mixup/ folder can be controlled from /mobile_controller/
